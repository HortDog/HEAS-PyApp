      "how do you differentiate exponential's": "**Chain Rule for Exponential Differentiation**\n\nLet f(x) = a^(g(x)), where a is a constant and g(x) is a differentiable function. Then, the derivative of f(x) is given by:\n\n```\nf'(x) = a^(g(x)) * g'(x) * ln(a)\n```\n\nwhere ln(a) is the natural logarithm of a.\n\n**Steps to Differentiate Exponential Functions:**\n\n1. **Identify the base:** Determine the constant a that is being raised to a power.\n2. **Identify the argument:** Determine the function g(x) that is inside the parentheses.\n3. **Differentiate the argument:** Find the derivative of g(x) using the appropriate differentiation rule.\n4. **Apply the chain rule:** Multiply the result from step 3 by the base a^(g(x)) and ln(a).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**1. Differentiate f(x) = 2^x:**\n\n* a = 2\n* g(x) = x\n* g'(x) = 1\n* ln(a) = ln(2)\n\nSo, f'(x) = 2^x * 1 * ln(2) = **2^x * ln(2)**\n\n**2. Differentiate f(x) = e^(x^2 + 3):**\n\n* a = e\n* g(x) = x^2 + 3\n* g'(x) = 2x\n* ln(a) = 1 (since e is the base of the natural logarithm)\n\nSo, f'(x) = e^(x^2 + 3) * 2x * 1 = **2xe^(x^2 + 3)**\n\n**3. Differentiate f(x) = 10^(sin(x)):**\n\n* a = 10\n* g(x) = sin(x)\n* g'(x) = cos(x)\n* ln(a) = ln(10)\n\nSo, f'(x) = 10^(sin(x)) * cos(x) * ln(10) = **10^(sin(x)) * cos(x) * ln(10)**"
