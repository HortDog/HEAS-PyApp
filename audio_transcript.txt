* Gradually consolidated his power, drafting a new constitution that gave him extensive executive powers.
* Crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804.

**Reign as Emperor:**

* Expanded French territory through military conquests, including victories at Austerlitz, Jena, and Friedland.
* Reorganized the French state, implementing the Napoleonic Code, a comprehensive system of laws that laid the foundation for modern civil law.
* Established the Grand Empire, a vast European confederation that included France, Italy, Spain, and parts of Germany.

**War and Defeat:**

* His ambitions led to his downfall.
* Invaded Russia in 1812, but suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Borodino.
* Forced to retreat from Russia during the harsh winter, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of soldiers.
* Defeated by a coalition of European powers at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

**Exile and Death:**

* Abdicated the throne and was exiled to the island of Elba.
* Escaped from Elba in 1815 and attempted to regain power, but was defeated again at Waterloo.
* Exiled for the second time, this time to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean.
* Died at Saint Helena on May 5, 1821, at the age of 51.

**Legacy:**

* Regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history.

how do you differentiate exponential's

**Chain Rule for Exponential Differentiation**

Let f(x) = a^(g(x)), where a is a constant and g(x) is a differentiable function. Then, the derivative of f(x) is given by:

```
f'(x) = a^(g(x)) * g'(x) * ln(a)
```

where ln(a) is the natural logarithm of a.

**Steps to Differentiate Exponential Functions:**

1. **Identify the base:** Determine the constant a that is being raised to a power.
2. **Identify the argument:** Determine the function g(x) that is inside the parentheses.
3. **Differentiate the argument:** Find the derivative of g(x) using the appropriate differentiation rule.
4. **Apply the chain rule:** Multiply the result from step 3 by the base a^(g(x)) and ln(a).

**Examples:**

**1. Differentiate f(x) = 2^x:**

* a = 2
* g(x) = x
* g'(x) = 1
* ln(a) = ln(2)

So, f'(x) = 2^x * 1 * ln(2) = **2^x * ln(2)**

**2. Differentiate f(x) = e^(x^2 + 3):**

* a = e
* g(x) = x^2 + 3
* g'(x) = 2x
* ln(a) = 1 (since e is the base of the natural logarithm)

So, f'(x) = e^(x^2 + 3) * 2x * 1 = **2xe^(x^2 + 3)**

**3. Differentiate f(x) = 10^(sin(x)):**

* a = 10
* g(x) = sin(x)
* g'(x) = cos(x)
* ln(a) = ln(10)

So, f'(x) = 10^(sin(x)) * cos(x) * ln(10) = **10^(sin(x)) * cos(x) * ln(10)**
